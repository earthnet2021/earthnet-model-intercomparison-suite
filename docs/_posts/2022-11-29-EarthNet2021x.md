We are happy to announce an updated dataset: [EarthNet2021x](https://www.earthnet.tech/en21x/download/)!

It has some extras (that is what `x` stands for):
- Files are now netCDF (having proper georeferencing)
- Landcover map included
- New cloud mask
- New Scoring with a focus on vegetation modeling
- No more mesoscale weather

We have prepared a [little Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/earthnet2021/earthnet-toolkit/blob/master/notebooks/exploring_earthnet2021x.ipynb) to get you started with it!

Looking forward to hear your thoughts ðŸš€
