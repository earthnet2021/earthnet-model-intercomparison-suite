We are in Geneva!

On Wednesday, July 5th 2023, Chris Requena and Vitus Benson are giving a talk on "Forecasting drought impacts with machine learning" in the AI for Good Global Summit workshop on [The Role of AI in Tackling Climate Change and its impacts - from Science to Early Warning](https://aiforgood.itu.int/event/the-role-of-ai-in-tackling-climate-change-and-its-impacts-from-science-to-early-warning/).

Afterwards, on Thursday and Friday July 6th-7th, the whole EarthNet team will be at ELLIS Unit Jena booth of the [AI for Good global summit](https://aiforgood.itu.int/summit23/).
Find us in the Swiss Zone at Booth 9.3 and let's have a chat on earth observation, deep learning and climate risk mitigation! üõ∞Ô∏èü§ñüåç
