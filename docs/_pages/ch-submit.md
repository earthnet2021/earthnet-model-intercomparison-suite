**WIP, to be further developed.**

Scores can be submited to the leaderboard by directly editing and creating a pull request to `docs/pages/leaderboard.md`. New entrie to the leaderboard must link to either of these: a technical document describing the model used, a publication or the source code of the model that generated the results. If there are major reasons why the model must remain unknown to the public but still the group want to entry to the leaderboard please contact the [EN-Team](/about/)
