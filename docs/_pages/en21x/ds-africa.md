In the context of H2020 DeepCube project, we are creating a newer and better dataset of minicubes suitable for Earth Surface Forecasting. In contrast to EarthNet2021, the new dataset is focused on Africa and the task is centered around drought impact forecasting.

Learn about H2020 DeepCube and drought impact forecasting in Africa in [DeepCube-H2020.eu](https://deepcube-h2020.eu/use-cases/forecasting-localized-extreme-drought-and-heat-impacts-in-africa/)

You can download the demonstrator minicubes from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5079843#.YOgrCegzb-g)

**Attention:** the dataset is provisional and not suitable for scientific applications.

The final version of the dataset might be released at a future date as a new iteration of the EarthNet initiative (e.g., EarthNet2022: Africa). To keep yourself informed about future releases you can follow us in Twitter [@EarthNetTeam](https://twitter.com/EarthNetTeam)
