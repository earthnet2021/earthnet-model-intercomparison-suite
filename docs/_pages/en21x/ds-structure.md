Nothing clever here ðŸ˜‰. Every sample is stored as a compressed numpy array .npz. File structure follows `<split_name>/<tile_name>/<cube_name.npz>`

```bash

**ProTip:** Each cubename has format `tile_startyear_startmonth_startday_endyear_endmonth_endday_hrxmin_hrxmax_hrymin_hrymax_mesoxmin_mesoxmax_mesoymin_mesoymax`. So contains the exact spatiotemporal footprint of the particular sample.
